      "description": "Redux is an awesome way to build front-end apps; unfortunately, it doesn't explain much in the ways of structuring, organizing, and testing your code when building medium to large sized SPA applications.  Joe is going to talk a little about the best practices he's discovered in his own Redux journey and hopefully help save someone somewhere the time he's already spent trying to figure it all out."
