      presentation: "A module system is important. Some would argue that for maintainable JavaScript having some sort of module system is the *most* important thing you can do. Yet for many, introducing ES6, RequireJS, or browserfy mid-project is a nonstarter. That's why George wrote simple-modules - a micro-library built specifically to make it easy for brownfield projects to transition to using a sane JavaScript module system."
